    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am an undergraduate student in an accelerated program, completing
      graduate-level coursework alongside my undergraduate studies.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic interests include data visualization, applied statistics,
      mathematical proof-based analysis, and computational modeling.
      I enjoy working with real-world datasets and communicating results
      clearly through visualizations and written analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site serves as a collection of my academic projects, coursework,
      presentations, and papers.
